DRINK COASTER THAT I MADE USING AN ARDUINO BREADBOARD AND C.

Small Project that utilizes a(n)

- RGB LED -> For Feedback Purposes 
- TMP36  -> For Temperture Sensing Purposes
- LDR -> Light Sensor Purposes for detecting CUP Placement

Did not use Switch Statements because they are weird in Arduino.
